Tech used: HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript

How It's Made: When creating this website I focused on making it functional first before I went in and applied the CSS. I created the basic layout on HTML and added a form. the form is what would allow the user to input their birthdate information. For this particular website I created a for loop with multiple if statements. Each of the statements contained each of the horoscopes and the range of their dates.

Lessons Learned: Through this project particular project I was able to become more comfortable using for loops.
